Make an Array and create individual values from A-Z

Start

Prompt the user to input a message.

shift calculation:
    Find the array position of each corresponding letter that was input.
    Find the amount of each letter that was input.
    Mutiply the amount of each letter input with their corresponding array value position.
    Add the sums, then use 'shift amount = (sum of letters â€“ 1) % 25 + 1' to keep the shift
    within the array.

Hash string:
    Find the amount of each letter from the original input.
    Make an algorithm that takes the array and asigns a number to each value
    and make those asigned numbers equivilant to the amount in the input.

Cipher:
    Using the shift number that was produced, the original input, and the array.
    Encript the original input by replacing the letters from the original input with letters
    from the array that are in a position 'shift number' away from the original.
    also use .upper to capitalize the output.
